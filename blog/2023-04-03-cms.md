The `onlySettings` property is now available for merchants to create content types intended for settings only. ​​This option is particularly useful for content types that do not require storefront content, like an SEO page.

This property ensures that the content type page displays only the available settings without the **Sections** tab. Follow the steps below to use the `onlySettings` property for your desired content type.

## What has changed?

Previously, when creating or editing a settings-only content type, two tabs were displayed: one for sections and another for page settings. However, for some content types like SEO pages, which do not have storefront content, the Sections tab was not relevant.

Now, the `onlySettings` property allows the creation of content types meant for settings only. This change improves content management and simplifies interface navigation for merchants by displaying only one settings tab on the page.

## Why are we making this change?
The change enables the creation of setting-only content types that do not require storefront content, and simplifies interface navigation by displaying only one tab for the page configuration.

## What needs to be done?
