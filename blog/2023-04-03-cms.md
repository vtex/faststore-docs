The `onlySettings` property is now available for merchants to create content types intended for settings only. ​​This option is particularly useful for content types that do not require storefront content, like an SEO page.

This property ensures that the content type's page displays only the available settings without the **Section** tab.
Follow the steps below to use the `onlySettings` property for your desired content type.

## What has changed?

Previously, when creating or editing a settings-only content type, there were two tabs on the page: one for sections and one for page settings. However, for some content types like SEO, which do not have storefront content, the Sections tab was not relevant.

Now, the `onlySettings` property allows the creation of content types meant for settings only. This change improves content management and improves interface navigation for merchants by displaying only one configuration tab on the page.

## Why are we making this change?
The change enables the creation of setting-only content types that do not require storefront content and simplifies interface navigation by displaying only one tab for the page configuration.

## What needs to be done?
Follow the instructions in [Using `onlySettings` property in a content type](https://www.faststore.dev/how-to-guides/cms/vtex-headless-cms/Using%20onlySettings%20property%20in%20a%20content%20type) documentation and add the property to your store.
