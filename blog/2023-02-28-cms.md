# Introducing Media Admin

We are pleased to announce the release of **Media Admin**, a media gallery manager designed to help you efficiently manage your digital assets. With Media Admin, you can upload and organize your media files, whether they are PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG, or WEBP.

You can also integrate Media Admin into **Site Editor** and **Headless CMS** so users can access and manage their media files from within these platforms. For more information, refer to [Using the Media Gallery as a CMS widget](#using-the-media-gallery-as-a-cms-widget).

## Features

### Uploading files

### Visualizing files

Media Admin has two visualization modes - **grid** and **list** view. You can switch between these views to better locate and preview media files by clicking the list or grid icon in the top right.

The grid view displays a thumbnail preview of each file, while the list view shows the files in a detailed list.

### Searching and filtering files

Media Admin allows you to filter files by the newest, oldest, and name (in ascending or descending order). You can also search for specific file names using the search bar.

### Managing files

You can use Media Admin to preview your digital assets, download them to your local device, delete them if they're no longer needed, or copy their URLs to use them elsewhere.

## Using the Media Gallery as a CMS widget

Media gallery can be used as a widget in **Site Editor** and **Headless CMS**. All management actions are accessible within the widget, which is displayed in a modal. Check the video below to see the Media widget being used in each CMS solution.

- **Headless CMS**

- **Site Editor**

Note that the **Media Admin** app  is associated with the VTEX account, meaning that both the **Site Editor** and **Headless CMS** will have access to the same gallery of media files.

Another important point to keep in mind is that if you delete a file from the media gallery that is being used in a section of the document, it will still be displayed in the section.
